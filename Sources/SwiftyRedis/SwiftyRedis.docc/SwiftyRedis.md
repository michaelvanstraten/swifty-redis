# ``SwiftyRedis``

A high level async redis library for Swift.

## Overview

SwiftyRedis is partially rewritten and heavily inspired by the [redis-rs](https://github.com/redis-rs/redis-rs) rust crate.
It provides convenient access to all Redis functionality through a very flexible but low-level API. 

It has a customizable type conversion protocol ``SwiftyRedis/FromRedisValue`` so that any operation can return results in just the type you are expecting. 
This makes for a very pleasant development experience.
